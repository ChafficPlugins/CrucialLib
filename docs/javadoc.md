# Javadoc

Javadoc is automatically generated and committed to this repository on each GitHub release via the [Generate Javadoc](./../.github/workflows/javadoc.yml) workflow.

!!! info
    Javadoc will appear here after the first CrucialLib release. Until then, refer to the [API Guide](api-guide.md) for usage examples and API documentation.

Once generated, the full API reference will be available in the `docs/javadoc/` directory of this repository.
